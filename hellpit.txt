Step1,
Installed CUDA 11 & cudnn 8, after days of effort still fails to build, finally gave up.
Caffe is old, and the branch I used was even older, that it doesn't support anything newer than CUDA 10 & cudnn 7.5.
CUDA 10 doesn't support any nvidia driver newer than 410.
And on ubuntu 18.04, both the official version and the ppa version of nvidia-410 are not working(5 reinstalls to confirm),
so had to switch to 16.04.
After all the modifications of makefile.config and makefile, successfully built the MobileNet-SSD.
Moral of the story: use something new and popular.


Step2, download pictures and label using labelImg, python3 labelImg.py, creates xml annotations.
Labels that are too similar won't work, learned from the hard way.
Step3, follow the MobileNet-SSD instruction to create list of train, train validation, validation annotation sets with lmdb. No spaces or brackets...
Step4, use gen_model to generate the deploy/train/test.prototxt, argument is number of labels and generated from template.
Step5, modify solver_train.prototxt and train.
Step6, use no_bn to create model and prototxt without norm batch layers, to increase speed.
Step7, ncnn has a slightly different input layer, so prototxt has to be modified:
layer {
  name: "input"
  type: "Input"
  top: "data"
  input_param {shape {xxxxx}}
  }
Step8, build ncnn and use caffetoncnn tool to generate ncnn param and bin files.
Step9, study the two android projects and try to make the model work.
